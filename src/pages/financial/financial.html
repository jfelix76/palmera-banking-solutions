    <p>Regardless of risk profile, bank and credit union compliance programs can be efficiently managed while producing examiner approval. These regulations require many man hours, resources, procedures and systems.</p>

    <p>Palmera can ensure that the BSA area is not seen as just a “cost center” by executive management. Successful tactics for BSA/AML Compliance come from those who have managed this difficult operation within a banking environment.</p>

    <p>We have practical experience designing and implementing compliance programs, working through compliance deficiencies, creating work-arounds for ineffective AML monitoring systems, overcoming staffing shortages, and delivering quality results to examiners.</p>
