      “Should you find the need for expertise, I highly recommend Sarah Beth Whetzel and Palmera Banking Solutions as a candidate to assist your organization in the area of BSA/AML and OFAC Compliance.  I worked with Mrs. Whetzel in 2010 and 2011 through various consulting engagements. Mrs. Whetzel was part of the team engaged to help remedy our BSA/AML/OFAC Compliance function which was under serious regulatory scrutiny.  With her assistance, enforcement actions placed on the organization were lifted in less than 12 months. Not only does she thoroughly understand regulation but she knows how to apply it to the operations of a financial institution to ensure compliance in a practical manner while identifying and eliminating gaps and providing efficiency.” <br>  – BSA/AML Officer $2B Bank

      “The first year she conducted only the validation review and both the management team and audit department were very impressed so we brought her on-board for the entire BSA audit engagement. We received favorable reviews on the quality of the systems review from our examiners. The nature of the validation is ultimately very beneficial as she will provide insight to not only the data integrity and mapping of your system but will also provide insight to the quality of alerts. You will go in to your next Exam extremely confident with your monitoring systems. In light of what you were hoping for from your systems audit this year, I believe you will find that with Palmera.” <br>  – BSA Officer, $3B Bank
