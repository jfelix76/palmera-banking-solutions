  <h2>Impact of Palmera's Services</h2>
  <p>
    AML and OFAC requirements impact the bottom line, the front line and in some 
    organizations, every area in between. Palmera provides tailored and cost-effective 
    solutions for applicable regulatory requirements. Anti-money laundering and OFAC 
    regulations affect many industries â€“ banking, technology, transaction processing, 
    mortgage banking, and insurance. Palmera provides expert advisory, consulting and 
    auditing services that enable easy navigation of these extensive, and often 
    resource consuming, requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
    Compliance with AML and OFAC regulations are dependent on various processes and 
    systems within an organization. Inefficiencies in both human and technology-based 
    processes most often lead to issues of non-compliance. Our company specializes in 
    remedying compliance issues as well as diagnosing areas that can be more efficient 
    in order to reduce the opportunities for compliance issues.
